This microservice was created as a result of the OpenReq project funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme under grant agreement No 732463.

== Technical description
=== What does the microservice do
The goal of this microservice is to classify a list of app reviews as either a __bug report__ or a __feature request__. 
The source code to get classified reviews (including data cleaning, machine learning feature extraction, and classification based on pre-trained models code that is necessary to perform these tasks is bundled in a single Docker container). 
The response of the microservice is a list of app reviews that now includes the class they belong to.

=== Which technologies are used
- Docker (-> https://www.docker.com/)
- SentiStrength (-> http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/)
- Stanford POS Tagger (-> https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml)

=== How to install it
*ri-analytics-classification-google-play-review* requires you to:

. aquire the sentistrength library from http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/ 

. mount the SentiStrength.jar file in the Docker run environment (e.g., docker run --rm -d -v "<PATH_TO_SENTISTRENGTH>/SentiStrength.jar:/SentiStrength.jar")

. aquire link:https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-postagger-full-2016-10-31.zip[stanford-postagger-full-2016-10-31.zip] and upload a zip file to google drive and set the Docker ARG __GDRIVE_DL_LINK__ to Google Drive sharing ID (docker build --build-arg "GDRIVE_DL_LINK=<SHARE_ID>"). This will download and unzip the Stanford POS Tagger files from Google Drive.

Run the following commands to start the microservice:

1) docker build -t --build-arg "GDRIVE_DL_LINK=<SHARE_ID>" ri-analytics-classification-google-play-review .
2) docker run -v "<PATH_TO_SENTISTRENGTH>:/SentiStrength.jar" -p 9651:9651 ri-analytics-classification-google-play-review


=== How to use it (high-level description)
The API is documented by using Swagger2:
