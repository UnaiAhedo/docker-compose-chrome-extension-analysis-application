"David M","Nov 14, 2018","4","well, simply if your trying to record a movie, or record your self gaming. this sucks, it will lag out out of everything.
i do like that you can have your webcam and the tab open at the same time, you you can talk while showing it on the screen.
also it gives you 50 free vids per month or somthing. honestly i never exceede 2. some people may use this more than me though. if you dont buy premium it will gove you some basic tools, but this is not a super high class extention that I use much. still. it dont take up storage so im just keeping it.
id sujest it to any one that needs to make some simple vids for school or somthing like that, not for anything pro.
also i think they should make it where you can also stream stuff live. but its laggy enough allready."
"Jack Rogers","Nov 3, 2018","1","This is horrible they make you have to buy the editing for the video and they also don't have a way to get rid of there branding on your video even if you could buy it they should still have a way to get rid of it at least make it to were you can move it."

Our premium subscriptions remove the watermark completely. The editor is available as a premium feature. However, there is a free trial available if you would like to give it a try before you buy. You can access the free trial here - https://editor.screencastify.com/free_trial

"Regine Canillas","Nov 15, 2018","1","Screencastify do not stand behind their product. My experience is that it's terrible software. I spent 4+ hours changing settings and trying to get the right mic configuration to no avail. It would only use the external mic to record video instead of the internal sound recording. I emailed support at least 15 times and eventually they made me feel like it was my problem or my fault and that this was probably the first example of such a failure they had ever ever ever experienced. And then when i said i could no longer justify spending more time trying all the different options to fix the problem the response was \"I cannot process your refund since we have a no-refund policy which is detailed in our terms. I'm afraid you'll get the same response from anyone else in the company. \". LESSON: anyone who reverts immediately to say that the refusal to do the right thing and respond to a genuine complaint is buried in \"the terms and conditions\" is a BIG red flag. Surely if you have a good product and good support but cannot solve the exceptional occasion when some technical thing causes a failure to use the product then you would be more than happy to refund that customers purchase. But in this case the immediate response was a denial. All that says is that the problem probably isnt unique and that they certainly do not stand behind their product."
"Lady Space","Nov 24, 2018","1","I'm brand new to this stuff so pardon my ignorance but I'm looking for info regarding the mic situation. Do I need to buy a mic to record videos with sound (me speaking for example)? I tried a couple test videos and no sound was recorded. I think the only option it gave me was internal mic."
"Dennis G D","Oct 17, 2019","5","I use it everyday. Very good. A small wish, that there was an audio indicator in the preview window so I know that audio is being recorded... paid version produces gifs, mp4 and you can crop/edit for just pieces of the video. Nice."
"Brian Baker","Nov 14, 2018","4","Works really well. No software to bloat your computer or learn. Simple and straigt forward. Its worth it to get the Premium version."

"Shen Feng Yong","Nov 7, 2018","2","Very bad voice recording, a lot of voice not cancelled"
"Liz Schneidewin","Nov 26, 2018","2","Hi, I had the same experience the first time I used the recorder but the instructional library showed me how to change the settings to make it work. Turn off the external microphone (unless you want to record your own overlay commentary) then select 'Show more options' on the recording dialogue box. This will give you the option to record Tab Audio. This is what worked for me. Good luck."
"A Google User","Nov 8, 2018","2","Hi there, 

We're sorry to hear that your recording included a ton of additional noise. Generally, this can be reduced by recording in a quiet room and optimizing the microphone in Screencastify settings. If that doesn't work, will you contact us at support@screencastify.com?

i do like that you can have your webcam and the tab open at the same time, you you can talk while showing it on the screen.
also it gives you 50 free vids per month or somthing. honestly i never exceede 2. some people may use this more than me though. if you dont buy premium it will gove you some basic tools, but this is not a super high class extention that I use much. still. it dont take up storage so im just keeping it.
id sujest it to any one that needs to make some simple vids for school or somthing like that, not for anything pro.
also i think they should make it where you can also stream stuff live. but its laggy enough allready."

"Regine Canillas","Nov 15, 2018","1","Screencastify do not stand behind their product. My experience is that it's terrible software. I spent 4+ hours changing settings and trying to get the right mic configuration to no avail. It would only use the external mic to record video instead of the internal sound recording. I emailed support at least 15 times and eventually they made me feel like it was my problem or my fault and that this was probably the first example of such a failure they had ever ever ever experienced. And then when i said i could no longer justify spending more time trying all the different options to fix the problem the response was \"I cannot process your refund since we have a no-refund policy which is detailed in our terms. I'm afraid you'll get the same response from anyone else in the company. \". LESSON: anyone who reverts immediately to say that the refusal to do the right thing and respond to a genuine complaint is buried in \"the terms and conditions\" is a BIG red flag. Surely if you have a good product and good support but cannot solve the exceptional occasion when some technical thing causes a failure to use the product then you would be more than happy to refund that customers purchase. But in this case the immediate response was a denial. All that says is that the problem probably isnt unique and that they certainly do not stand behind their product."
"Lady Space","Nov 24, 2018","1","I'm brand new to this stuff so pardon my ignorance but I'm looking for info regarding the mic situation. Do I need to buy a mic to record videos with sound (me speaking for example)? I tried a couple test videos and no sound was recorded. I think the only option it gave me was internal mic."
"Dennis G D","Oct 17, 2019","5","I use it everyday. Very good. A small wish, that there was an audio indicator in the preview window so I know that audio is being recorded... paid version produces gifs, mp4 and you can crop/edit for just pieces of the video. Nice."

"Liz Schneidewin","Nov 26, 2018","2","Hi, I had the same experience the first time I used the recorder but the instructional library showed me how to change the settings to make it work. Turn off the external microphone (unless you want to record your own overlay commentary) then select 'Show more options' on the recording dialogue box. This will give you the option to record Tab Audio. This is what worked for me. Good luck."
"A Google User","Nov 8, 2018","2","Hi there, 

We're sorry to hear that your recording included a ton of additional noise. Generally, this can be reduced by recording in a quiet room and optimizing the microphone in Screencastify settings. If that doesn't work, will you contact us at support@screencastify.com?

And then when i said i could no longer justify spending more time trying all the different options to fix the problem the response was \"I cannot process your refund since we have a no-refund policy which is detailed in our terms. I'm afraid you'll get the same response from anyone else in the company. \". LESSON: anyone who reverts immediately to say that the refusal to do the right thing and respond to a genuine complaint is buried in \"the terms and conditions\" is a BIG red flag. Surely if you have a good product and good support but cannot solve the exceptional occasion when some technical thing causes a failure to use the product then you would be more than happy to refund that customers purchase. But in this case the immediate response was a denial. All that says is that the problem probably isnt unique and that they certainly do not stand behind their product."

Perhaps it takes a system that has enough horsepower to use it.  I also introduced this program at work to make videos showing how to reproduce GUI bugs.  Have never heard of anyone having issues using it.  

Love that videos are uploaded to google accounts.  Since work uses google as our mail system we can limit our video views to email addresses on our domain only.  Very helpful."

also it gives you 50 free vids per month or somthing. honestly i never exceede 2. some people may use this more than me though. if you dont buy premium it will gove you some basic tools, but this is not a super high class extention that I use much. still. it dont take up storage so im just keeping it.
id sujest it to any one that needs to make some simple vids for school or somthing like that, not for anything pro.
also i think they should make it where you can also stream stuff live. but its laggy enough allready."

"Jeremy S","Nov 24, 2018","5","Have been using it for several years on multiple systems without issue.  Curious why some people are having issues running it and experiencing lag.  Perhaps it takes a system that has enough horsepower to use it.  I also introduced this program at work to make videos showing how to reproduce GUI bugs.  Have never heard of anyone having issues using it.  

Love that videos are uploaded to google accounts.  Since work uses google as our mail system we can limit our video views to email addresses on our domain only.  Very helpful."

"AdMan The Lab Rat","Dec 6, 2018","4","WE LOVE IT, so much even got the upgrade and have been intuitively using it for well over a year now.
Then school decides to buy three years of M$N 365 and our Master Professors 'prefer' we use Scream'O-Matic then we have to ditch both of those because neither plays nicely with the Non-Chrome Compliant \"Lock-Down Browser\" (Honesty & Integrity Maintainer -Nah, more like false sense of Security and a waste of educational funds, time and other scarce much needed resources.

"JB CASES","Nov 29, 2018","5","This extension has been invaluable.  Simple to use and just works.  I used the free version for a long time and donated/paid to support them for building such an awesome product.  So easy to communicate to my team and customers with short videos rather than the tedious process of lots of back and forth texting/talking."

"Murat Assanov","Nov 23, 2018","5","I have my business out of country where I actually live. Sometimes I waste too much time to explain to my employee what and how to do. It takes too much time for me and for my employee. That was a reason why I started looking something to improve my efficiency in it. I didn't spend too much to get known how it works. It's very simple program to use and it works very effectively for me. I like this program and hope it will never be stopped."

"Liz Schneidewin","Nov 26, 2018","5","I just used screencastify for the first time this morning. It took five minutes to figure out the basics thanks to the excellent instruction library. It works.

"DoodleDotDot","Nov 16, 2018","3","It's laggy but if your recording short videos it's okay to use and also it has editing so that's a plus"
"A Google User","Nov 19, 2018","3","laggy? "
"Fabian Mccray","Nov 12, 2018","3","Bad: Why does it have to pay FOR EVERY THING EDITING, RECORDING, At least add a limited amout of this stuff! Its LAGGY as well

Good: It uses your camera while recording! It does record good and gives you acces to tools. I guess you can still edit it on YT too."
"A Google User","Dec 5, 2018","3","Im quite sure thats why things like OBS exist, and if you were expecting a good recorder and editor, get off of chrome web store."
"A Google User","Nov 20, 2018","3","good jod"
"Minoumimi","Nov 16, 2018","3","well you can simply download the file has if it was in a folder and edit it in our own software.. O_o
but ya.. the branding is... not something i can allow
try out webrtc"
"David M","Nov 14, 2018","4","well, simply if your trying to record a movie, or record your self gaming. this sucks, it will lag out out of everything.
i do like that you can have your webcam and the tab open at the same time, you you can talk while showing it on the screen.
also it gives you 50 free vids per month or somthing. honestly i never exceede 2. some people may use this more than me though. if you dont buy premium it will gove you some basic tools, but this is not a super high class extention that I use much. still. it dont take up storage so im just keeping it.
id sujest it to any one that needs to make some simple vids for school or somthing like that, not for anything pro.
also i think they should make it where you can also stream stuff live. but its laggy enough allready."
"Jack Rogers","Nov 3, 2018","1","This is horrible they make you have to buy the editing for the video and they also don't have a way to get rid of there branding on your video even if you could buy it they should still have a way to get rid of it at least make it to were you can move it."
"A Google User","Nov 8, 2018","1","Hi Jack, 

Our premium subscriptions remove the watermark completely. The editor is available as a premium feature. However, there is a free trial available if you would like to give it a try before you buy. You can access the free trial here - https://editor.screencastify.com/free_trial

"Regine Canillas","Nov 15, 2018","1","Screencastify do not stand behind their product. My experience is that it's terrible software. I spent 4+ hours changing settings and trying to get the right mic configuration to no avail. It would only use the external mic to record video instead of the internal sound recording. I emailed support at least 15 times and eventually they made me feel like it was my problem or my fault and that this was probably the first example of such a failure they had ever ever ever experienced. And then when i said i could no longer justify spending more time trying all the different options to fix the problem the response was \"I cannot process your refund since we have a no-refund policy which is detailed in our terms. I'm afraid you'll get the same response from anyone else in the company. \". LESSON: anyone who reverts immediately to say that the refusal to do the right thing and respond to a genuine complaint is buried in \"the terms and conditions\" is a BIG red flag. Surely if you have a good product and good support but cannot solve the exceptional occasion when some technical thing causes a failure to use the product then you would be more than happy to refund that customers purchase. But in this case the immediate response was a denial. All that says is that the problem probably isnt unique and that they certainly do not stand behind their product."
"Lady Space","Nov 24, 2018","1","I'm brand new to this stuff so pardon my ignorance but I'm looking for info regarding the mic situation. Do I need to buy a mic to record videos with sound (me speaking for example)? I tried a couple test videos and no sound was recorded. I think the only option it gave me was internal mic."
"Dennis G D","Oct 17, 2019","5","I use it everyday. Very good. A small wish, that there was an audio indicator in the preview window so I know that audio is being recorded... paid version produces gifs, mp4 and you can crop/edit for just pieces of the video. Nice."
"Brian Baker","Nov 14, 2018","4","Works really well. No software to bloat your computer or learn. Simple and straigt forward. Its worth it to get the Premium version."
"charlotte","Nov 10, 2018","5","It's so cool! I can finally record videos on YouTube!"
"Shen Feng Yong","Nov 7, 2018","2","Very bad voice recording, a lot of voice not cancelled"
"Liz Schneidewin","Nov 26, 2018","2","Hi, I had the same experience the first time I used the recorder but the instructional library showed me how to change the settings to make it work. Turn off the external microphone (unless you want to record your own overlay commentary) then select 'Show more options' on the recording dialogue box. This will give you the option to record Tab Audio. This is what worked for me. Good luck."
"A Google User","Nov 8, 2018","2","Hi there, 

We're sorry to hear that your recording included a ton of additional noise. Generally, this can be reduced by recording in a quiet room and optimizing the microphone in Screencastify settings. If that doesn't work, will you contact us at support@screencastify.com?
